# (Ford goBIke Trip Data)
## by (Fatiat Temitope Hammed)


## Dataset

The dataset entails information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The data covers gobike trip ride during the month of february 2019.


## Summary of Findings

> Summarize all of your findings from your exploration here, whether you plan on bringing them into your explanatory presentation or not.


Our main variable of interest in finding the determinants of riders decision to share trip are the trip duration, day and time of take off and individuals age and user type.  Surprisingly,even using the log value for trip duration,we did not observe any strong correllation between the trips duration and individual age. There are some interesting observation in relationship between the individuals age and categorical variables. The average age of those who share bike ride is lower than average age of those who do not. We can say riders above the age of 35yrs do not share bike ride as to younger individuals.

From the categorical data, we observe that more subscribers share their bike ride than customers. Ride share frequency in the evening and afternoon tends to be higher than other time of the day. With regards to the day of the week, less ride trips are taken on weekends compared to weekdays and thereby also expected that less ride share will take placeon these days.

Aside our point of interest, we try to observe the take off and destination stations. From the violin plots, we can observe that the trips taken within station H have higher trip duration compared to other station group. But individual that takes trip within stations in groupF tends to share their bike rides compared other groups. More investigation will be carried out on the bike share for trips and these station groups.



## Key Insights for Presentation


In the presentation, I focused on our main variable of interest. I started by introducing the dataset, followed by the trip duration average and riders age distribution.
Using bar plots, i introduced the categorical variables. Afterwards I used the violin plots of price and age across the categorical data. The categorical variable trip share was plot against other variables; age, user type, trip take off day and period.  I've made
sure to use different color palettes for each quality variable to make sure it is clear that they're different between plots.
